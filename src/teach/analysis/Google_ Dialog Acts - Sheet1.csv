- tag with affirm/yes intent",Yes,"[Nikhil] I don't think this is same as yes. We might wanna configure backchannel a separate intent with action_listen as the bot response
[NR] Can be made a separate intent but it appear to be be a verbal affirmation and might not even be relevant to text conversation. These are kind of informal affirmation more relevant in speech conversations
[Nikhil] Let's skip for now then
[NR] agreed"

- tag with affirm/yes intent",Yes,"[Nikhil] Should this be part of ""continue"" button?
[NR] Continue for the most part is Yes. So this will be handled.
[Nikhil] What do you mean by ""for the most part""?
[NR] What I have observed is that Continue is linked with yes button havent seen any negative example of it yet 
[Nikhil] My question is slightly different. If the user is shown ""Continue"" button, and they type ""yeah"" -> NLU will tag it as ""Yes"" intent. After that will ""Continue"" button be triggered?
[NR] yes it will be if the continue buttons paraphases are tagged along yes"

- tag with no/deny intent",Yes,"[Nikhil] I don't think this should be grouped with ""deny"" intent. Maybe we can look at other paraphrases for this before making a decision on. how to handle.
e.g. 
Bot: Did you mean ""Add, Remove, payment..."" article? 
- buttons: [Yes, No]
User: I don't know
In this case, we might want to reply with ""Since you are uncertain, I can proceed with this information. You can ask me to stop if you think this is not the right information.""
[NR] This is ambigous . Proceeding with it means we club it with Yes. for which user has already said he dont know or not sure (clubbing it with No will make more sense). Either we skip it or club with No
[Nikhil] Can you share other paraphrases in this intent?
[NR] I have not extracted parahares for any of these dialogue acts yet.
[Nikhil] Definition of ""Other answers"" from the switchboard corpus: For responses to y/n questions that are neither affirmative responses (""yes"" or ""Indeed I do"") nor negative responses (""no"" or ""I don't think so""). The most common case is ""I don't know""
It deserves an intent of it's own for sure. We can configure a rule that says ""Since you are uncertain if this is the right answer, let's try again. Can you describe your issue in more detail?"" 
[NR] Creaing a new intent out of it is agreed. 
[Nikhil] Add separate intent and follow same payload as ""No"" intent"
